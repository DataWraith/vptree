vptree is a port of Steve Hanov's C++
[implementation](http://stevehanov.ca/blog/index.php/?id=130) of [Vantage-point
trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vantage-point_tree) to the Go programming
language. Vantage-point trees are useful for nearest-neighbour searches in
high-dimensional metric spaces.
